# math_lib.py
add takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

div takes two integers as arguments and returns their quotient.

Fixed an issue with div function where division by zero was not accounted for. Division by zero will now result in a a print readout instead of an error.

# Calculate.py
calculate.py uses methods from math_lib in order to generate multiple outputs (division and addition) from two arguments supplied by the user. Calculate provides a print readout to show the user the results of these methods.

# run.sh
Executes calculate.py through a bash shell, with arguments 400 and 21 as an example usage.
